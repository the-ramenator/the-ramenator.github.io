# the-ramenator.github.io

Hey! I'm the Ramenator, and this I like coding. You can go to my website, which is the-ramenator.github.io to learn more about me, steal my stuff, and play my games! My motto is "Press Ctrl+U to steal", because I make small scale projects for people to fork and build on. You don't have to give credit to me, but it would be nice. If you stuck around since I made this website, you'd have noticed a name change. I realized that putting my real name on an online website wasn't a good idea, so with the help of <a href="https://bowswa.github.io/">Bowswa</a> I rebranded myself to The Ramenator.
You can find out more about making a website like this by googling "Github Pages".
Thanks! Bye.
